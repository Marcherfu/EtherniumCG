Here's the Official Tier-List of the Lackey Plugin v2.5.   
**Take in consideration that the nature of those winrates is only coming from my strategic researchs being alone and they're, probably, not exactly true. I coudln't do it in another way due to lack of activity on the game.**   

**Tier 1** - The best classes of the game, dominating the meta.

**Tier 2** - Correct classes, playables in the meta but needing some knowledge of the class.

**Tier 3** - The worst classes in the game, hard to play in the actual meta.

**Undefined Tier** - We're currently working to see where to put them in the Tier List.
