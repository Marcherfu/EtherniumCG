Mage :
	Buffs
-The Clay Wall now cost 10 less to play.
-The Earthquake now cost 1 less to play for each time you casted the "Clay Golem Summon" spell during the game.
-The 3 Summons Spell (Blazing Summon, Icy Summon and Earth Summon) cost 2 less to play.
-The Forst Golem now cost 1 less to play for each card in your hand and each card in play instead of each card with the Ice sub-type in your hand and each card in play.
	Nerfs
-The Upgrade Cost of the Clay Golem Summon spell is now 6 (instead of 5) and can't be less than 4 (instead of 3).
-The Clay Wall lost 10 HPs.
-The Earthquake now cost 5 more to play.
	Explanations
I'll be honest : the Mage class is a hard class to balance. I hope this time it be just "good" and not another time top tier dominating the meta (like this class is doing since the first version of the game...) ; so what i basically did is adding support to bad cards and nerfing the Upgrade of the most terrible one : Clay Golem Summon. Allowing it to be casted and bounced back in hand at Turn 3 was way too strong so i nerfed it to delay it by one turn, allowing more counterplay to it in early game.

Priest :
	Buffs
-The Recovery spell now makes you draw 2 cards if you cast it on a monster instead of 1 ; it also cost 1 less to play.
-The Reconstitution spell now also deal half the damages (rounded down) to the owner of the Zombie monster if a Zombie monster is targeted with this effect.
	Nerfs
-God of Devotion now cost 5 more to play and he can be Transformed & directly Destroyed. (still can't be Injured)
-The Recovery spell now gives to a player not 3 Recovery Counters but 2.
-The X in the Reconstitution spell is now equal to the number of monsters in play and not the number of cards in play.
	Explanations
A Priest who have a good draw can't lose, so he can only win most of the time. I like this being a thing in Priest but it's a little bit too much broken actually. So now the God of Devotion need more healing and the healing is nerfed down to force the Priest to take some time and not just do some Turbo-healing into a very early God of Devotion. I also added more counterplay to the God, allowing more classes to shut him down and not only classes who had some Banish effect.

Thief :
	Buffs
-The Pilferer now have Combo 2. (When you play this card, you can play an infinite amount of cards without paying their cost while the total mana cost of all thoses cards isn't more than 2.) instead of Combo 1 and deal 2 damages instead of 1 when he's used in a Combo capacity.
	Nerfs
-The Pilferer now cost 1 more to play.
-The Joker Copycat now summon 1 copy instead of 2 when he's played from a Combo capacity.
	Explanations
The Thiefs decks were stranges decks before the v2.5, carried only by an archetype which was really draw dependant. (Minesweeper Thief) So last time i added new cards and did a balance change, i was thinking about Aggro Thief and did some things to help this archetype to shine. What a huge mistake... It was making Aggro Thief a potential Tier 0 deck. (of course it wasn't a True T0 but it was way too strong for the metagame) So now, i'm fixing up things : having the option to flood the board with 8 1/1 + a 1/2 while putting 4 damages in the face + drawing 5 cards and all that at Turn 1 was just ridiculously broken. Fixed that by making the Pilferer unable to be played on Turn 1, making him a little bit trickier to use in a Combo capacity, especially on Turn 1.
